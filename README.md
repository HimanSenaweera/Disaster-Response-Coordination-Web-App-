Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and wildfires strike communities worldwide, often 
overwhelming local response systems. Effective disaster response requires rapid coordination 
of resources, real-time communication, and actionable insights from diverse data sources (e.g., 
text reports, images, and videos from affected areas). However, many disaster response 
systems lack the ability to intelligently process multimodal data, prioritize tasks, and provide 
user-friendly interfaces for volunteers, first responders, and affected individuals.
